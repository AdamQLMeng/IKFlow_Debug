# IKFlow_Debug
Solved the incompatibility of the official repo of IKFlow and the newest versions of dependencies and removed the dependence on pytorch_lighting (I hate it, writing the training code is not that complicated!).

Correct the bug in calculating the mean angular error. (It's a little mistake, but affects a lot.)
